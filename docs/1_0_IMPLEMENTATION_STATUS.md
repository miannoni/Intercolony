# Intercolony 1.0 Implementation Status

The continuity mechanism between sessions. Read `docs/INTERCOLONY_1_0_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
first; this file says where in that program we actually are.

Current stage:      Stage 0 — Program spine
Current slice:      0.3 — commercial timeline spine
Last completed:     0.1 — status ledger
Current save schema: 42 (43 once 0.3 lands)
Current mod version: 0.9.3
Branch:             `1.0` — branched from `main` at `0f55a27`, merges back at Stage 8

## Stage status

- [ ] Stage 0 — Program spine
- [ ] Stage 1 — Settlement economies
- [ ] Stage 2 — Market fundamentals overhaul
- [ ] Stage 3 — Circumstance-driven economic events
- [ ] Stage 4 — Brand strength & colony specialization
- [ ] Stage 5 — Commercial relationships & negotiation
- [ ] Stage 6 — Procurement parity
- [ ] Stage 7 — Commercial history
- [ ] Stage 8 — 1.0 integration and release gate

## Slice log

### 0.1 — status ledger (2026-08-19)

**Claim:** the program has a written continuity record that survives between sessions.
**Files:** `docs/1_0_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` (new).
**Schema:** unchanged.
**Tests:** none applicable.

## Decisions / deviations

### 2026-08-19 — Stage 0 — DECISION

**Question:** where do the 1.0 program's commits land, given Stage 0 bumps the save schema
and `main` will not be shippable again until Stage 8?
**Evidence:** 0.9.3 is live on Steam Workshop `3780094556` and public on GitHub. A beta
defect report is likely during a program this long, and `docs/BACKLOG.md` already holds
open items. Every prior phase committed straight to `main`.
**Choice:** a `1.0` feature branch. `main` stays at 0.9.3 and remains directly releasable
as a 0.9.4 point release without untangling half-built stage work.
**Why it preserves this plan:** nothing in the plan depends on branch layout; this only
protects the shipped release from an in-flight schema bump.
**Revisit if:** the program reaches Stage 8 with no intervening point release, in which
case the branch was merely bookkeeping and the merge is trivial either way.

### 2026-08-19 — Stage 0 — VERIFICATION

The plan's §4 architectural claims were checked against the code before any work began,
because the document was written by an audit rather than from this repository's history.
All of them hold:

- `SettlementEconomicProfile` is non-`IExposable` and regenerated from economy seed plus
  settlement ID (`Core/SettlementEconomicProfile.cs:48`).
- §4.3's cycle-noise claim is exact: `DemandFor(def, category)` rolls
  `Rand.Range(0.55f, 1.45f)` seeded on `RefreshCount`, smoothed over three cycles
  (`Core/SettlementEconomicProfile.cs:102`). This is what Stage 2 replaces.
- Schema is 42 with a one-step-per-version migration chain (`CurrentSaveVersion`,
  `MigrateIfNeeded`).
- `SupplierOfferConsumption` and `CommercialHistoryEntry` are both owned by
  `IntercolonyWorldComponent`.
- Every file path named in §4 and in the per-stage "likely code areas" resolves.

No correction to the plan is needed.

## Play evidence still required

Nothing yet from the 1.0 program. `docs/PENDING_PLAYTESTS.md` still holds the 0.9.x
backlog, which this program does not clear.

## Next executable slice

**0.3 — commercial timeline spine.** A bounded, persisted `CommercialEventRecord` list
owned by `IntercolonyWorldComponent`, written by the sale, purchase and contract paths
that already know these facts. Stage 7 renders it; Stages 3–6 write to it. It exists now
because the information it records cannot be reconstructed later.

Then **0.2 — capture the 0.9.3 market baseline** before Stage 1 changes it.
